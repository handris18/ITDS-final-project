# ITDS final project
In this project I tried various regression and forcasting techniques both on synthetic and real-world datasets.

I visualized mathematical functions and generated datasets from them. I framed regression tasks around them using some of the more common models and evaluated their performance.

I used the same regression pipeline to see it's behaviour on synthetic data, which I generated using scikit-learnâ€™s make_regression function.

I also performed a forcasting exercise with real-world weather data from during the second world war (source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/weatherww2 ). 
During the exercise I focused on finding stations with the most complete data, explored the relationship between the data and the location of stations. Finally I checked the performance of my model on forcasting the weather using only one station's data.
